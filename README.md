## Background 

The IMDb Dataset is a table that includes the 100 greatest movies of all time according to the rankings provided by IMDb up until the year of 2015. The table includes information regarding the IMDb rating, gross earnings (Million $), runtime (minutes), year of release and the total number of votes. 

## Challenges

With the dataset, we want to understand the business insights and metrics that can analyzed. A few challenges that come to mind are: 

* How can we simplify the segmentation of the years that the movies were released? 
* What are the important metrics to analyze for each segmentation breakdown? (i.e. genre, category, year, etc.) 
* Is there a correlation between the total gross of a movie compared to that of the other attributes within the dataset?
